A data analysis is **reproducible** if all the information (data, files, etc.) required is available for someone else to re-do your entire analysis. This includes:

-   Data available
-   All code for cleaning raw data
-   All code and software (specific versions, packages) for analysis

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some advantages of making your research reproducible are:

-   You can (easily) figure out what you did six months from now.
-   You can (easily) make adjustments to code or data, even early in the process, and re-run all analysis.
-   When you're ready to publish, you can (easily) do a last double-check of your full analysis, from cleaning the raw data through generating figures and tables for the paper.
-   You can pass along or share a project with others.
-   You can give useful code examples to people who want to extend your research.

::: r-fit-text
Some of the steps required to making research reproducible are:

-   All your raw data should be saved in the project directory. You should have clear documentation on the source of all this data.
-   Scripts should be included with all the code used to clean this data into the data set(s) used for final analyses and to create any figures and tables.
-   You should include details on the versions of any software used in analysis (for R, this includes the version of R as well as versions of all packages used).
-   If possible, there should be no "by hand" steps used in the analysis; instead, all steps should be done using code saved in scripts. For example, you should use a script to clean data, rather than cleaning it by hand in Excel. If any "non-scriptable" steps are unavoidable, you should very clearly document those steps.
